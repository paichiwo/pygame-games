# 1.AVOIDACAR

# Story:
This is the first game I have developed myself using pygame framework. 
The most difficult part was to loop the background endlessly, so it gives an illusion of motion.
With that done, it was only fun to experiment with pygame, and I have actually done more 
calculations than needed for this game like counting time or having a car accelerate with momentum.
I finally decided about all the rules in the game and got rid of some unnecessary functions, 
 however, save them in a folder to be used in future games.

# Let's play:
Well, you start on the road driving at 70km/h.
Your aim is to drive as long as you can avoid cars coming from another direction.
Every 1 km of distance gained rises your level and speed.
There are 10 levels in total, and when you beat 10th level game crashes :) 
When you bump in to other cars, there's basic bump behavior implemented.
You have a health bar that decreases with every bump, and when it reaches 0 you'll see the game over the screen.

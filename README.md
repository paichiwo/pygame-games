## SPACE RESISTANCE GAME

This is a game I developed with love and a PYGAME framework.

I've been born in the 80's, so my passion for computers and games comes from that era.
I still remember times when I used to spend all day (and my mom's pocket money)
in arcades playing everything I could. 

I wanted to develop a game that reminds me of those times, so SHOOT'EM UP genre was 
an obvious choice to learn pygame framework.  I even drew a lot of additional 
assets, experimented with PYGAME but most importantly, had a lot of fun while developing, 
and I hope you will have fun playing it.
